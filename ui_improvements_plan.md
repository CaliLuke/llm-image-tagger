# UI Improvements Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The llm-image-tagger application is a tool that:

- Analyzes images using AI to generate descriptions, tags, and extract text
- Stores metadata in a vector database for semantic search
- Provides a web UI for browsing and searching images

The current UI structure has:

- An initial screen for folder selection
- A main view with a header, search bar, and image grid
- A footer with API documentation links
- Modal components for detailed image viewing

## 2. Proposed Changes

We plan to restructure the application UI with these improvements:

1. **New Header Layout**
   - Relocate API documentation links from footer to header
   - Add application name to header
   - Maintain consistent header across all views

2. **Master-Detail Layout**
   - Create a split-view layout with left sidebar (1/3 width) and main content area (2/3 width)
   - Implement a directory browser in the sidebar showing ONLY directories
   - Add visual indicators for directories containing images
   - Maintain minimum width for sidebar to prevent layout issues

3. **Image Grid Improvements**
   - Keep existing image grid functionality
   - Ensure grid displays properly in the new layout
   - Maintain all current image processing capabilities

## 3. Implementation Approach

We will use a simple, direct approach to implement these changes:

1. **Maintain Single-File Architecture**
   - Continue using the static/index.html file with embedded Vue.js code
   - Use Vue.js components within the single file
   - No need for npm, Vite, or other build tools
   - Organize code into logical sections with clear comments

2. **Component Organization**
   - Create well-defined Vue components within the single file
   - Use clear section delimiters and comments
   - Maintain component hierarchy for clean organization
   - Ensure proper event handling between components

3. **Benefits of This Approach**
   - No build step required
   - No additional dependencies
   - Easier maintenance (all code in one file)
   - Compatible with the existing backend
   - Simpler deployment and debugging

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Analysis

- [x] Understand current UI structure
- [x] Analyze backend API endpoints
- [x] Create implementation plan

### Phase 2: Create Backend Support for Directory Navigation

- [x] Add API endpoint for listing directories
  - [x] `GET /directories` - Returns list of directories in current folder
  - [x] Include metadata about which directories contain images
- [ ] Ensure folder traversal security (prevent accessing sensitive directories)
- [x] **Test directory listing functionality independently**
  - [x] Verify metadata consistency across storage layers
  - [x] Log all storage operations
  - [x] Handle edge cases (empty folders, invalid permissions)

**Implementation Notes:**
The directory listing endpoint (`GET /directories`) has been implemented with the following capabilities:
- Returns a list of directories in the current folder
- Includes metadata about which directories contain images and metadata files
- Handles permission errors gracefully
- Includes proper logging for all operations
- Returns appropriate error responses for edge cases (no folder selected)

Configuration changes:
- The `Settings` class in `config.py` has been updated with required fields for proper application function
- Path handling in tests has been improved to ensure proper object typing

Next technical requirements:
- Implement folder traversal security checks
- Begin implementing the directory browser component in the UI

- [ ] Test directory navigation independently before integration

### Phase 5: Integrate Directory Browser with Image Grid

- [ ] Update image loading to work with directory selection
- [ ] **Ensure state consistency across all storage layers:**
  - JSON files (image_metadata.json)
  - Vector store (.vectordb)
  - In-memory state (router.current_folder)
- [ ] Verify metadata persistence across directory changes
- [ ] Add proper logging for all state changes
- [ ] Test full navigation flow with real data

### Phase 6: Final Testing and Refinement

### Directory Browser Component

The directory browser will be implemented as a Vue component with:

- Tree-like structure for directory hierarchy
- Icons for directories and visual indicators for those with images
- Event handlers for directory selection
- Proper overflow handling with scrolling

```html
<!-- Example structure for directory browser -->
<div class="directory-browser min-w-64 overflow-y-auto border-r">
  <div v-for="dir in directories" class="directory-item">
    <div @click="selectDirectory(dir.path)" class="flex items-center p-2 hover:bg-gray-100">
      <span class="icon">üìÅ</span>
      <span class="name">{{ dir.name }}</span>
      <span v-if="dir.hasImages" class="indicator ml-2">üñºÔ∏è</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### API Endpoints for Directory Browser

New API endpoint needed:

```python
@router.get("/directories")
async def list_directories(path: Optional[str] = None):
    """
    List all directories at the specified path or current folder.
    Includes metadata about which directories contain images.
    """
    current_path = path or router.current_folder
    if not current_path:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="No folder selected")
    
    try:
        # Get directories
        directories = []
        for entry in Path(current_path).iterdir():
            if entry.is_dir():
                # Check if directory contains images
                has_images = False
                try:
                    # Check for images in the directory
                    has_images = any(
                        child.suffix.lower() in ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.webp'] 
                        for child in entry.iterdir() if child.is_file()
                    )
                    
                    # Also check if metadata exists for this directory
                    metadata_file = entry / "image_metadata.json"
                    has_metadata = metadata_file.exists()
                    
                    directories.append({
                        "name": entry.name,
                        "path": str(entry),
                        "hasImages": has_images,
                        "hasMetadata": has_metadata
                    })
                except (PermissionError, OSError) as e:
                    # Handle permission issues gracefully
                    logger.warning(f"Could not access directory {entry}: {str(e)}")
                    directories.append({
                        "name": entry.name,
                        "path": str(entry),
                        "hasImages": False,
                        "hasMetadata": False,
                        "error": "Access denied"
                    })
        
        logger.info(f"Found {len(directories)} directories in {current_path}")
        return {"directories": directories}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error listing directories: {str(e)}")
        logger.error(traceback.format_exc())
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Failed to list directories: {str(e)}")
```

### Directory Selection and State Management

We'll need to carefully handle state updates when changing directories:

```javascript
async function selectDirectory(directoryPath) {
  try {
    // Show loading state
    this.isLoading = true;
    this.loadingStatus = "Loading directory...";
    
    // Call API to open the selected folder
    const response = await fetch('/api/open-folder', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ folder_path: directoryPath })
    });
    
    // Handle the response
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      
      // Update application state
      this.folderPath = directoryPath;
      this.images = data.images;
      this.currentDirectory = directoryPath;
      
      // Show success notification
      this.showNotification('success', 'Directory Loaded', `Loaded ${data.images.length} images`);
    } else {
      // Handle error
      const error = await response.json();
      this.showNotification('error', 'Error', error.detail || 'Failed to load directory');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error selecting directory:', error);
    this.showNotification('error', 'Error', 'Failed to load directory');
  } finally {
    this.isLoading = false;
    this.loadingStatus = "";
  }
}
```

## 7. Fallback and Error Handling

- Implement graceful degradation if directory listing fails
- Add error notifications for directory access issues
- Include fallback to full folder view if needed
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Log all errors with appropriate context
- Handle permissions and access issues elegantly

## 8. Performance Considerations

- Optimize directory scanning to minimize delays
- Consider caching directory information where appropriate
- Implement efficient state management to reduce rerenders
- Use loading indicators for long-running operations
- Consider pagination for directories with many subdirectories

## 9. Metadata Synchronization Strategy

To maintain consistency between all storage layers, we'll follow these principles:

1. **Consistent Loading**
   - When opening a directory, load metadata from JSON first
   - Sync vector store with loaded metadata
   - Update in-memory state with both sources

2. **Consistent Updates**
   - When changing directories, save current state before loading new
   - Update all storage layers in a consistent order
   - Verify consistency after updates

3. **Error Recovery**
   - If vector store sync fails, attempt to rebuild from JSON
   - If JSON load fails, create new metadata if possible
   - Log all synchronization events for debugging

4. **Testing**
   - Test all state transitions thoroughly
   - Verify metadata consistency after directory changes
   - Simulate error conditions to test recovery

## 10. Conclusion

This plan outlines a methodical approach to restructuring the UI with a new header and master-detail layout. By using a simple, direct approach with the existing single-file architecture, we can improve the UI while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

The implementation will prioritize:

1. Maintaining metadata consistency across all storage layers
2. Providing clear feedback during all operations
3. Handling errors gracefully
4. Following established code patterns and conventions
