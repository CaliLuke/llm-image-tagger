# Data Storage Reorganization Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to reorganize the application's data storage and improve queue persistence by moving from file-based storage to database storage. The goal is to create a cleaner, more maintainable and reliable system.

## Current Issues

- Data files scattered across multiple locations
- Queue state stored in files, risking consistency issues
- Unclear organization of persistence data
- Potential for file write errors during critical operations
- Failing tests that need to be fixed before reorganization

## Best Practices Checklist

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] Use meaningful variable and function names
- [ ] Keep functions small and focused
- [ ] Add proper type hints
- [ ] Handle all potential exceptions

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Update docstrings for all modified functions
- [ ] Add module-level documentation
- [ ] Update README with new information
- [ ] Document database schema
- [ ] Include migration instructions

**Testing:**
- [ ] Write unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Update existing tests for changed code
- [ ] Test error conditions and edge cases
- [ ] Verify performance under load
- [ ] Test migration process thoroughly

**Database Operations:**
- [ ] Use transactions for critical operations
- [ ] Implement proper connection pooling
- [ ] Handle database errors gracefully
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient errors
- [ ] Use prepared statements for security

**Security:**
- [ ] Protect database credentials
- [ ] Validate all inputs
- [ ] Sanitize data before storage
- [ ] Use least privilege principle
- [ ] Avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each database operation individually
   - Test migration functions
   - Verify error handling

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test queue processing end-to-end
   - Verify data consistency across operations
   - Test concurrent access

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Database connection failure
   - Partial transaction completion
   - Migration interruption
   - Concurrent writes

## Decision Points & Considerations

- **Database Type**: ChromaDB vs SQLite for queue persistence
- **Migration Strategy**: One-time vs gradual migration
- **Backward Compatibility**: How long to maintain support for file-based queue
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Per operation vs per batch
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic vs manual intervention

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Database connection issues | Medium | High | Add robust retry logic and fallback mechanisms |
| Data migration errors | Medium | High | Implement validation and rollback capability |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Benchmark and optimize database operations |
| Breaking existing functionality | Medium | High | Comprehensive test coverage and gradual rollout |
| Multiple test failures | Medium | Medium | Fix issues incrementally rather than all at once |

## Rollback Plan

In case of serious issues:

1. Restore file-based queue persistence code
2. Revert directory structure changes
3. Update configuration to use old paths
4. Restore data from backups if necessary 

## Three-Layer Storage Consistency Reminder

As emphasized in the AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md, we must always ensure consistency across all storage layers:

```
{
    "json_files": "<image_folder>/image_metadata.json",  # Persistent metadata
    "vector_store": ".vectordb",                         # Search index
    "memory_state": "router.current_folder",            # Runtime state
}
```

For any metadata-modifying endpoints, follow this checklist:
- [ ] Load current metadata
- [ ] Validate input
- [ ] Update vector store
- [ ] Update JSON storage
- [ ] Return consistent response
